### Example Conversation

```
You: I have a PDF /Users/sean/Documents/report.pdf, how many pages?
AI: Let me check... This PDF has 50 pages, titled "2024 Annual Report"

You: Read the first 5 pages
AI: Reading pages 1-5... [displays content and images]

You: Continue reading pages 6-10
AI: Reading pages 6-10... (using cache, faster)

```

It's that simple. AI automatically calls PDF Reader to complete all technical operations.
