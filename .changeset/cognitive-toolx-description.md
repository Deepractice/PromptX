Improve toolx tool description with Why-When-How cognitive structure for better AI agent comprehension

This change restructures the toolx tool description from traditional documentation style to a cognitive navigation system that significantly improves AI agents' ability to understand and use the tool correctly.

Key improvements:
- Added "Why ToolX Exists" section to establish semantic anchors and meaning
- Added "When to Use ToolX" with explicit IF-THEN decision rules for scenario matching
- Added "How to Use ToolX" with complete, copy-paste-ready code examples showing actual mcp__promptx__toolx function calls
- Each pattern includes "What this does" explanations to reinforce cause-effect relationships
- Restructured from abstract YAML format documentation to concrete executable code templates

This approach is inspired by successful teaching-assistant role patterns and reduces cognitive load by transforming inference tasks into pattern-matching tasks for AI agents.
