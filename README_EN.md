## 🚀 **Quick Start - 30-Second Setup**

Open your configuration file and copy the `promptx` configuration code below. This is the simplest **zero-configuration mode**, where PromptX automatically handles everything for you.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "promptx": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "-f",
        "--registry",
        "https://registry.npmjs.org",
        "dpml-prompt@beta",
        "mcp-server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration Parameters:**
- `command`: Specifies using npx to run promptx service
- `args`: Startup parameters configuration list
  - `-y`: Auto-confirm
  - `-f`: Force refresh cache
  - `--registry`: Specify registry source
  - `https://registry.npmjs.org`: Use official registry
  - `dpml-prompt@beta`: Use stable beta version
  - `mcp-server`: Start service

**🎯 It's that simple!** Save the file and restart your AI application, and PromptX is successfully activated.

> **💡 Tip:** The configuration specifically uses the official registry `registry.npmjs.org` to avoid installation issues caused by unofficial mirrors. If you find the installation slow, it's recommended to use a proxy tool for acceleration rather than switching to alternative mirrors.

### 🌐 **Advanced Configuration: HTTP Mode Support**

In addition to the local mode above, PromptX also supports **HTTP mode**, suitable for remote deployment or special network environments:

```bash
# Start HTTP mode server
npx -f -y dpml-prompt@beta mcp-server --transport http --port 3000
```

Then use in client configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "promptx": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### ⚙️ **How It Works**

PromptX acts as a "professional capability middleware" between you and your AI application, communicating through the standard [MCP protocol](https://github.com/metacontroller/mcp).

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Your AI App (Claude,Cursor,etc.)"
        A[👨‍💻 User Interaction]
    end

    subgraph "PromptX MCP Server"
        C{PromptX Engine}
        D[🎭 Role Library]
        E[🧠 Memory & Knowledge]
    end

    A -- "Calls 'promptx_...' tools" --> B(MCP Protocol)
    B --> C
    C -- "Accesses" --> D
    C -- "Accesses" --> E

    subgraph "Enhanced Response"
        F[✨ Professional Output]
    end
    C --> F
```

When you call the `promptx_...` series of tools, your AI application sends the request via the MCP protocol to PromptX. The PromptX engine loads the appropriate professional roles, retrieves relevant memories, and then returns a professionally enhanced result to your AI application, which is ultimately presented to you.

### New to MCP? [Watch MCP Tutorial on BiliBili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1HFd6YhErb)

All AI clients that support the MCP protocol can use PromptX. This includes major applications like **Claude Desktop**, **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, **Cline**, **Zed**, **Continue**, and many more mainstream AI development tools that are integrating MCP support.

**🎯 After configuration, your AI application will automatically gain 6 professional tools:**
- `promptx_init`: 🏗️ **System Initialization** - Automatically prepares the working environment.
- `promptx_hello`: 👋 **Role Discovery** - Browse all available expert roles.
- `promptx_action`: ⚡ **Role Activation** - Transform into an expert in a specific domain with one click. **(Includes Nuwa🎨 Role Creation Consultant)**
- `promptx_learn`: 📚 **Knowledge Learning** - Have AI learn specific knowledge or skills.
- `promptx_recall`: 🔍 **Memory Retrieval** - Look up historical information from the memory repository.
- `promptx_remember`: 💾 **Experience Saving** - Store important information in long-term memory.
